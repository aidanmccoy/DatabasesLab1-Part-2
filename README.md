The 'C' option searches for a classroom and lists all the students in it. The 'C: T' option searches for a classroom and lists all the teachers that teach in it. 'G: T' finds all teachers that teach the input grade. Enrollment is displayed with the 'E' option, and analytical data is given with the 'D' option.
